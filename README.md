In this mini-project, we will be working with a data set of baby names in France. It contains the list of all baby names registered in France, year by year, from 1900 through 2019. There are two data sets: one aggregated to the national level, and another with data by department. 

Our goal is to create 3 different visualizations around these data, each focussed on answering different kinds of questions about the data:

- **Visualization 1**: This section is done on the Tableau visualization sotfware, answering the most general questions to get a feeling of our data. The questions it aims to anwser are : 
  - How do baby names evolve over time? 
  - Are there names that have consistently remained popular or unpopular? 
  - Are there some that have were suddenly or briefly popular or unpopular? 
  - Are there trends in time?
  
- **Visualization 2**: This section is realized using Dash, Dash which is an application that give a point-&-click interface to models written in the Python progamming language, vastly expanding the notion of what's possible in a traditional "dashboard." In this segment, we will be answering :
  - Is there a regional effect in the data?  
  - Are some names more popular in some regions? 
  - Are popular names generally popular across the whole country?

- **Visualization 3**: Are there gender effects in the data? Does popularity of names given to both sexes evolve consistently? (Note: this data set treats sex as binary; this is a simplification that carries into this assignment but does not generally hold.)
